Task Manager API
The Task Manager API is a RESTful backend service that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, this API enables users to create, update, retrieve, and delete tasks, providing a solid foundation for any task management application. With robust authentication and data handling, it offers a secure and reliable experience for handling task-related information.

Project Features:

   User Authentication:
     Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
     Password hashing for security with bcrypt.  
     Role-based access control for different levels of task management.
     
  Task CRUD Operations:

  Create: Users can add new tasks with details such as title, description, due date, and priority level.
  Read: Users can retrieve individual or all tasks, filter tasks by completion status, due date, and priority, and sort results.
  Update: Users can update task details, including status, description, and due date.
  Delete: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
  
  Advanced Filtering and Sorting:

  Filter tasks by completion status, priority, and due date.
  Sort tasks by creation date, due date, or priority to view them in a preferred order.

  
Pagination:

Paginated results for tasks, allowing users to view tasks in smaller, manageable chunks.

Error Handling and Validation:

Centralized error handling for all endpoints, with custom error messages.
Data validation with middleware to ensure consistency and prevent invalid data from being processed.

Logging and Monitoring:

Logs for tracking important events like user actions, errors, and system warnings, to enhance debugging and auditing.


Tech Stack:

Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime for building a scalable backend.
Express: Web application framework for managing routing and middleware.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user and task data, with Mongoose as an ORM to define data schemas.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure, stateless authentication.
Bcrypt: For hashing passwords, adding an extra layer of security.


API Endpoints:
Auth Endpoints:

POST /auth/register: Register a new user.
POST /auth/login: Authenticate user and return JWT.
Task Endpoints:

POST /tasks: Create a new task.
GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks (supports filtering, sorting, pagination).
GET /tasks/
: Retrieve a specific task by ID.
PATCH /tasks/
: Update a task by ID.
DELETE /tasks/
: Delete a task by ID.
User Endpoints (optional, for managing user profiles if applicable).

Future Improvements:
Implement notifications or reminders for tasks nearing their due dates.
Add collaborative features for shared tasks.
Integrate analytics to track user activity and task completion trends.
